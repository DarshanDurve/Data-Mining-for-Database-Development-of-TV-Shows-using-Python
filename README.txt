This is a Project called 'Data Mining for Database Development of TV Shows using Python'

Highlights -
1) Developed a database for TV shows by gathering, scraping, munging and cleaning the real world data and populating the tables with the help of the Entity-relationship model
2) The data was collected from a myriad of sources such as web scraping using Beautiful Soup and Request, crawling of Twitter API with Python, and a dataset consisting of the ratings of TV shows.
3) Structured the data, scraped by looping through the HTML tags into a data frame using Pandas
4) Twitter API was used to make API calls for concatenating hashtags to the show name of the sand ultimately looping through them for data wrangling of the TV shows
5)The CSV files of all the database entities show a thematic relation between all these entities
